### About

I'm a 3rd year MS (Research) scholar in Computational Science at IIT Madras, Chennai, India. As an interdisciplinary student, I belong to the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras. I am advised by [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/). 

### Research Areas

Optimization Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks  

### Research Projects :
#### Stabilizing Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
With [Akshat Dave](https://adaveiitm.github.io/) (PhD, Rice University), [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/)

We work on a variant of GAIL to stabilize the training and generate smoother policies. We show some results on how smooth cost functions result in smooth policies and measure the performance of continuous control tasks based on novel metrics to measure the quality of the imitation achieved by the agent. This work is under review at a conference.

#### Cellular Localization as SDP
with [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/)

This works casts the problem of localization in cellular networks as a Semi-Definite Program. We aim to improve the accuracy of the existing methods by correcting for LOS/NLOS error. Certain connections that we aim to draw are with matrix completion and Eucledian Distance Matrices. 

### Publications :
Akshat Dave*, Sapana Chaudhary*, Balaraman Ravindran "SILC: Smoother Imitation with Lipschitz Costs" (2017). Accepted for poster presentation at the Deep Learning Symposium at Thirty First Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2017. (* Equal Contribution)

### Mentoring :
#### Analysing mode missing in generative adversarial networks
With Rahul Vallivel (BTech, NIT, Trichy), [Dr. Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/), [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/)

We analyse various issues with training Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs). We concentrate specifically on the problem of missing modes in generative densities modelled by GANs.

#### Generalization in Imitation Learning
With [Nived Narayanan] (BTech, IIT Madras)

We aim to make the policies learned by an imitating agent generalize well to multiple domains.
